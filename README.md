# OpenCV-Colourspace-Test

vidloader.py - This Python 3 script uses Opencv to load a video (samplevid.mp4 is provided), allows the user to select a Region of Interest (ROI) before continuing, and generates colour histograms for that ROI in three different colourspaces before saving them as a .npy file.

loadhists.py - This Python 3 script loads .npy files generated by the first script and graphs the histogram for each colourspace for each frame.
